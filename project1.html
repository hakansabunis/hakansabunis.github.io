            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>For the successful completion of the autonomous car project, me and my four teammates successfully developed and implemented a mathematical model and artificial intelligence approach using the OpenCV library. We demonstrated object detection and speed limit recognition by adding four signs to the track: Speed 5cm/sec, Speed 10cm/sec, Speed 20cm/sec, and a Stop sign.</p>
            <p>During the demonstration, the autonomous vehicle correctly set the speed limits and adjusted its speed accordingly within 2-3 seconds. Additionally, the vehicle adhered to the track's boundaries, ensuring it stayed inside the 50 cm wide road and avoided crossing the white lines on both sides.</p>

            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Successfully implemented object detection and speed limit recognition using the OpenCV library.</li>
                <li>Accurately recognized and adjusted speed based on traffic signs within 2-3 seconds of detection.</li>
                <li>The vehicle stayed within the track’s boundaries, adhering to the white line restrictions on both sides.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Library:</strong> OpenCV for image processing and object detection</li>
                <li><strong>Microcontroller:</strong> Arduino Uno</li>
                <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> C++ for embedded systems</li>
                <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection</li>
                <li><strong>Motor Driver:</strong> L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver</li>
                <li><strong>Camera:</strong> ESP-32 Camera Module</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges Overcome</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial camera image quality issues resolved by replacing the ESP32 camera with a mobile phone camera.</li>
                <li>Encountered coding errors and cable connection issues were resolved through teamwork and testing.</li>
            </ul>
