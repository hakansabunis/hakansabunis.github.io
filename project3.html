            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The objective of this project was to design an amplifier capable of amplifying ECG signals by at least 1000 times. The amplifier was designed for various biological signals, with a primary focus on ECG signals. The project involved three key phases: amplifier design, filter implementation, and testing.</p>

            <h2>Design Specifications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amplification:</strong> The circuit was designed to amplify ECG signals by a factor of 1000.</li>
                <li><strong>Instrumentation Amplifier:</strong> LM348N op-amp was used for its low noise characteristics.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Powered by two 9V batteries to avoid mains noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Filters:</strong> Designed and implemented low-pass, high-pass, and notch filters to improve signal clarity and eliminate noise.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Components</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Instrumentation Amplifier: LM348N</li>
                <li>Power Supply: Two 9V batteries</li>
                <li>Resistors and capacitors for filter design</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Filter Design</h2>
            <p>Various filters were designed and implemented to improve the clarity of the ECG signals. The filters aimed to remove high-frequency noise, eliminate DC offset, and reject 50Hz power line interference.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low-Pass Filter:</strong> Reduced high-frequency noise.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Pass Filter:</strong> Removed DC offset.</li>
                <li><strong>Notch Filter:</strong> Rejected 50Hz power line interference using a Twin-T configuration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The amplifier successfully amplified the ECG signals by the required factor.</li>
                <li>High-frequency noise was significantly reduced using the low-pass filter.</li>
                <li>The high-pass filter effectively removed DC offset, while the notch filter eliminated 50Hz power line interference.</li>
            </ul>
